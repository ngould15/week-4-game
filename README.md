# week-4-game
<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>This is a simple numbers game with a beach theme. To begin playing the game, just click on one of the seashells to see what that seashell is worth. You will want to continue to add the seashells up to equal the random number that was populated for this round. If you go over the number, you lose. If you match the random number, you win! If you win, your win count will increase by "1" and then you will move on to the next randomly generated number. If you lose, your lose count will increase by "1" and then you will move on to the next random number. </p>
