        <p>Sally wants to buy a new surfboard! In order to earn the remaining money needed to buy the board, she needs to sell
            sea shells. The amount of money Sally still needs to sell in sea shells will be shown at the start of the game.</p>
        <p>There are four sea shells below. By clicking on a sea shell, you will add a specific number of points to your total
            score.
        </p>
        <p>In order to win the game, you must match the Total Amount of Shells Sold to the Amount Sally Needs to Make. You will
            lose the game if your total score goes above the amount Sally needs.</p>
        <p>The value of each sea shell is hidden from you until you click on it.</p>
        <p>Each time a new round starts, the value of each sea shell will change.</p>
